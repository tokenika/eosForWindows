The minimum version of CMake required on your Linux machine is 3.8, and it must also support server mode. 

Download the Visual Studio 2017 Preview, install the Linux C++ Workload, and try our CMake support for Linux with your code. Let us know how it is or isnâ€™t working for you. Your feedback matters.
